## Current State of Portfolio

The website is currently mostly the same as the original template, albeit with some content and CSS changes. I chose this starter because it (1) didn't include Contentful, which was giving me authentication issues, (2) included the basic building blocks of what I needed to create something similar to my low-fi mockups, (3) is based off of React, and (4) included animations which I hope to modify. I chose Gatsby as a framework since it sounded like a great solution for a portfolio—fast and customizable. 

I've since gone through their initial tutorial projects, getting a better understanding of how Gatsby works (e.g., specific files it pulls from, what GraphQL is, etc.) 

I was able to deploy the website via Netlify at [https://sleepy-turing-af1f56.netlify.app/](https://sleepy-turing-af1f56.netlify.app/), since I'm already using my allocated Github Page for hosting a past project (like... really way back, in 2016). 


## Future State of Portfolio
I want to [​add animations​](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/) to the website using things like react-spring. I could try ​adding [different page transitions](https://css-tricks.com/animating-between-views-in-react/)​ as well. Or ​[a laser pointer-like cursor](https://codepen.io/StephenScaff/pen/Jjdveyw)​.

I will have to continue work on the portfolio website past the stated due date to make it more unique and personalized. Getting started with Gatsby took a bit longer than expected, and taking time to try and understand the large swathe of code available in the starter, and what to modify where, took additional time too. At this time, it's a work-in-progress project! But, it should be easy to update since the Github repository and the deployed website has been setup.
